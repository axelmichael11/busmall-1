### Marketing Research Team

As the marketing resarch team we want: 

*a clean looking website with clear directives  
*We want to see three of our directory images side by side at each turn the user takes 
*We do not want to see any duplicated images in the users turn, as well as no repeated images directly before the users turn 
*We want the numbers of clicks on each image to be calculated so that we can have clear data on how many times each image is chosen  
*In addition to calculating clicks, we also want to have data that can give us a clear idea of the percentage of times each specific catalog item was clicked.

### Developer Team

As the developers for this project we want:

*to create a function that will bring three directory images to the screen.  Need to figure out how to make sure none of the three displayed images are the same and that there are no duplicates of that image in the three images diplayed just before the current display
*to create a clean webpage, with clear directives to let the user know how we want thme to use the page.
*create a way to track, store, calculate and visually display the resulting data.
